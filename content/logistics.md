## Use of AI for classwork 
Despite large language models being in the name of this course, please engage with the readings using your own brain. I recommend you minimize interruptions, cut yourself off from the Internet and grapple with the readings. Write down questions as you read. It's fine to look things up or chat with an LLM to help you understand things, but it is helpful to keep in mind that the work you are doing for the course is not for impressing me or getting a good grade. It is in the service of helping *you* do good science, to create useful knowledge.
